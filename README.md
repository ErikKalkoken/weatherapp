## Installation

You can run the app directly from the repository. For that your system needs to be able to build Fyne apps, which requires you to have installed the Go tools, a C compiler and a systems graphics driver. For details please see [Fyne - Getting started](https://docs.fyne.io/started/).

When you have all necessary tools installed, you can build and run this app direct from the repository with:

```sh
go run github.com/ErikKalkoken/weatherapp@latest
```
